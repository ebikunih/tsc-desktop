========================================
tsClinical Metadata Desktop Tools v1.1.0
    Released on: November 1, 2022
========================================

New features and bug fixes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) [Convert from Excel to Define-XML] and [Convert from Define-XML to
    Excel] functions have been fully rewritten to add or improve the
    following functionality:
    - Both Define-XML 2.0.0 and 2.1.n are now supported.
    - Import Analysis Results Metadata (ARM) to Excel is now supported.
    - Cases and spaces in input Excel column names are ignored when
      reading (e.g. "DataType", "Data Type" and "Data type" are all
      accepted as a valid column name.)
    - Separate METHOD and COMMENT sheets can be optionally used rather
      than writing them in each sheet.
    - Inconsistencies in Excel are now reported as warnings when
      creating Define-XML.
    - "No Data" column is now supported for both Define-XML 2.0.0 and
      2.1.n. For 2.0.0, datasets, variables and VLMs are not exported
      when "No Data" is Yes.
    - "Repeat N" column is now supported to replicate repeating
      variables (e.g. TSVALn, COVALn and RACEn). "Length" column now
      support multiple values to assign different legth to replicated
      variables.
    - Mappings between Excel and Define-XML have been updated. See
      Mapping_Design_Define.xlsx in the docs directory for details.
(2) A new [Convert from XML to HTML] menu has been added to enable
    creating HTML from Define-XML using a style sheet.
(3) Mappings from Architect CRF to CRF Spec have been improved. See
    Mapping_Design_Architect.xlsx in the docs directory for details.
(4) The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Potential error when reading blank cells in Architect CRF on the
      [Create CRF Spec from Datasets] menu has been fixed.
    - Error when reading date values with mixed formats in the same
      column on the [Create CRF Spec from Datasets] menu has been fixed.
    - '(' was used as a qualifier when '(None)' was selected on the
      [Create CRF Spec from Datasets] and [Create eDT Spec from Datasets]
      menus. The backspace (\b) is now applied as a qualifier when
      '(None)' is selected.
    - The [Convert from Excel to ODM-XML] menu always set "No" to the
　　　　　　Repeating attribute of ItemGroupDef　when the ItemGroupDef was
　　　　　　automatically created. The attribute　value is now the same as the
　　　　　 Repeating attribute of the FormDef.
    - The [Convert from Excel to ODM-XML] menu　now sets unique FormRef
      OrderNumber in the entire ODM document, rather than in each
      EventDef. This is a workaround of an issue that tsClinical for
      SDTM Automation generates Annotated CRF with TOC in an unexpected
　　　　  order.
    - Incorrect sorting algorithm of sorting fields could cause an
      error when importing Architect CRF. The algorithm has been fixed.
    - Parameters entered in the [Create CRF Spec from Datasets] screen
      were not reflected to the output STUDY sheet when "Datasets Text
      Files" is empty. The issue has been fixed.

      data types if they are consistent, or "text" if they vary.

      "integer" nor "float".
    - SignificantDigits of QVAL is produced when DataType is "float".
    - Length of QEVAL is derived from values in the Evaluator column.
(3) The default value of the oidMode property, referenced from the
    [Convert from Excel to ODM-XML] has been changed to "EXACT".
